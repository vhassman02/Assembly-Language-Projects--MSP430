# Assembly-Language-Projects--MSP430
 Assembly language code files for the TI MSP430 microcontroller used in Microprocessor System Design course

SPI CODE:
 ASM files that begin with SPI were used to interface with an LCD display over the serial peripheral interface. 

FULL CODE:
 The full assembly file for autonomous obstacle avoidance functionality. The autonomous car used sonar sensors and accelerometers to control DC drive motors via PWM. 

 ProgramFlow.pdf
  Documents the flow of the autonomous driving program.
